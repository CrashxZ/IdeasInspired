        <h1>Deadpool.</h1>
		<img src="style/dp.jpg" class="center" style="width:320px;height:463px"><p class="center">Poster</p>
        <p>After a bunch of shitty movies like ‘Green Lantern’ and his appearance in ‘X-Men Origins’ , Rayan Reynolds has finally redeemed himself in this Science fiction superhero flick, DeadPool!</p>
		<p>This movie is a smirking deconstruction of all the superhero movie excesses and clichés seen by far as it reinvents the “ManIn-The-Tights” genre with action sequences so violent and unflinching, and the humour so crude and twisted, it will challenge the most seasoned cinephiles to find a film that pulls off both as well. But, if there are any real (super) heroes in this production, it's the writers. The script, loaded with selfreferences, its takes on the superhero movie clichés, its bashing of production studios and of course, the sex jokes, crafted in such a manner that you'll be hard-pressed to find a single dull moment.</p>
		<p>From the very opening credits, it is clear that the creators of this one are not planning to hold back. In fact, keeping up with the notion of bringing something new to the table, every trick in the book is used to make it as outlandish and shocking as possibly, all the while dodging the pitfalls of such efforts.</p>
		<p>A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Wade Wilson played by Rayan Reynolds, is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Ed Skrein plays the bad-guy Ajax, who is being hunted by Deadpool so that he can exact some revenge after Ajax (as Deadpool puts it) "fu**ed up his face" in the experiment, which gave 'Pool his powers to begin with. But, as the film insists, this is also a love story and Deadpool's love is Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin.</p>
		<p>Although the major theme of the movie revolves around Wade's (Deadpool) attempts to reunite with Vanessa and save her from “not-so-good guys”, the "love story" completely blends into the overall hilarious tone of the movie. All the actors in the flick were great but Rayan Reynolds breaks the fourth wall by his performance in the movie. The fact that he realizes him being present in the movie is mind blowing. Deadpool was released on Valentine’s Day (14th February), if you’ve been waiting for the perfect Valentine’s Day movie, your wait is over –This is it!  </p>

		<h1>Forest Gump.</h1>
		<img src="style/fg.jpg" style="width:320px;height:463px" class="center"><p class="center">Poster</p>
		<p>I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.</p>
		<p>I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.</p>
		<p>The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.</p>
		<p>I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.</p>
		<p>The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,"I think it is a little bit of both." From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!</p>
